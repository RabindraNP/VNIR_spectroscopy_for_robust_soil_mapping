# Preface {-}

In the spirit of reproducible research, here we share the data and the computational code
used for carrying out the analyses presented in our paper ["Robust soil mapping at the farm scale with vis-NIR spectroscopy"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.12752) which is by the way open access. Before you go thorugh this code we strongly recoment to read our paper.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      eval = FALSE, 
                      tidy = TRUE, 
                      tidy.opts = list(indent = 20), 
                      size = "tiny")
```

```{r pressure, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./maps/paperimg.png")
```
