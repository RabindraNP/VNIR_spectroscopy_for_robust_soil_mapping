# Preface {-}

In the spirit of reproducible research, here we share the data and the computational code
used for carrying out the analyses presented in our paper ["Robust soil mapping at the farm scale with vis-NIR spectroscopy"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.12752) which is by the way open access. Before you go thorugh this code we strongly recoment to read our paper.
